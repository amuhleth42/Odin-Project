# Namaste JavaScript Playlist

## Episode 1

execution context
everything happens in the execution context
memory component -> variable environment, key-value pairs
code component -> thread of execution

Js -> synchronous, single-threaded language

## Episode 2

the execution context is created
1. Memory creation phase -> allocates memory to vars and functions
    for vars -> undefined
    for functions -> stores the whole inside code

2. Code execution
    variable assignations are executed
    for all function calls -> new execution context

it's like a reverse recursive thing, weird but really cool

call stack for interpreted language


functions can be anonymous, without a name
passed as function parameter

arrow functions : dinguerie, c'est chelou mais ultra pratique
